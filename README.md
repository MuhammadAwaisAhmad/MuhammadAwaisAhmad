- 👋 Hi, I’m @MuhammadAwaisAhmad
- 👀 I’m pationately curious about Blockchain and decentralized systems.
- ⭐ I am freelance Blockchain developer on Upwork.
- #### Solidity:
- 🌱 I am working in **Solidity** and **Ethereum Smart Contract** development since 2019.
- #### Rust + Ink:
- 💞️ I’m Trying to getting in bed with rust Programing language which would enable me to create **Substarte** based Blockchains in **Polkadot ecosystem**.
- 💞️ I am 1 date away form knocking out rust and bringing into this world a new Blockchain with new inovation and posibilities.
     Although we can impliment an instance of EVM(Ethereum Virtual maichine) pallet in Substarte based blockchain but by defaul smart contracts are written in ink programming language
- #### Haskell + Plutus:
- 💞️ I am also Fooling around with Haskell and Plutus based on Haskell for cardano development. Plutus is Haskell based so this also enables me to 
     deploy smart contracts on Cardano Blockchain.
